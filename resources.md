Tracing the conflict of wills and interests among modern nations, Ben Buchanan reveals little-known details of how China, Russia, North Korea, Britain, and the United States hack one another in a relentless struggle for dominance. His analysis moves deftly from underseas cable taps to underground nuclear sabotage, from blackouts and data breaches to billion-dollar heists and election interference.</td>

      <td>The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis has been required reading for intelligence officers studying the art and science of intelligence analysis for decades. Richards Heuer, Jr. discusses in the book how fundamental limitations in human mental processes can prompt people to jump to conclusions and employ other simplifying strategies that lead to predictably faulty judgments known as cognitive biases. These analytic mindsets cannot be avoided, but they can be overcome through the application of more structured and rigorous analytic techniques including the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses.</td>

I went from doing about a year of technical support back in 2010, to having a non-technical Access Management role for several years, then going straight into Incident Response. It was a HUGE jump. All of a sudden, I needed to know how to do digital forensics investigations, analyze malware, know what assembly code means, and a plethora of other things I didn’t know I needed to know. I definitely couldn’t afford to pay thousands of dollars for training.</td>

The information security community provides information to researchers, both publicly and privately. Most reports, however, focus on the outcome of the research, rather than the process. As such, there are a lot of reports that show the results, without explicitly stating how they were obtained. In this course, every step that is taken, is explained in detail. As such, one will gain insight in both the thought process, as well as the technical analysis.</td>
