      <td>Packed with insider information based on interviews, declassified files, and forensic analysis of company reports, The Hacker and the State sets aside fantasies of cyber-annihilation to explore the real geopolitical competition of the digital age. Tracing the conflict of wills and interests among modern nations, Ben Buchanan reveals little-known details of how China, Russia, North Korea, Britain, and the United States hack one another in a relentless struggle for dominance. His analysis moves deftly from underseas cable taps to underground nuclear sabotage, from blackouts and data breaches to billion-dollar heists and election interference.</td>

      <td>The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis has been required reading for intelligence officers studying the art and science of intelligence analysis for decades. Richards Heuer, Jr. discusses in the book how fundamental limitations in human mental processes can prompt people to jump to conclusions and employ other simplifying strategies that lead to predictably faulty judgments known as cognitive biases. These analytic mindsets cannot be avoided, but they can be overcome through the application of more structured and rigorous analytic techniques including the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses.</td>

    <td>When Einstein famously said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”  he could only imagine the horrors of future weapons. He had no way to foresee the advent of cyberwar. Whatever form any future war takes it is now apparent that cyber warfare will be part of it.<br>
    This four week short course introduces you to the rise of state sponsored cyber attack, a concept that only a few years ago seemed within the realm of science fiction.  You will be introduced to the major classes of cyber weapons: trojans, worms, and distributed denial of service, as well as sophisticated hacking. You will also learn the history of nation state involvement in cyber attack as well as the looming threat of cyber attack from terrorist organisations.</td>

      <td>Elan aka DFIR Diva here, an entry-level Incident Response Analyst trying to learn all things DFIR on a limited budget. I went from doing about a year of technical support back in 2010, to having a non-technical Access Management role for several years, then going straight into Incident Response. It was a HUGE jump. All of a sudden, I needed to know how to do digital forensics investigations, analyze malware, know what assembly code means, and a plethora of other things I didn’t know I needed to know. I definitely couldn’t afford to pay thousands of dollars for training.</td>

The information security community provides information to researchers, both publicly and privately. Most reports, however, focus on the outcome of the research, rather than the process. As such, there are a lot of reports that show the results, without explicitly stating how they were obtained. In this course, every step that is taken, is explained in detail. As such, one will gain insight in both the thought process, as well as the technical analysis.</td>
