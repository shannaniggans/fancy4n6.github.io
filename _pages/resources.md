<p>Last Updated: 2 June 2022</p>

I am quite often asked if there are sites, training, and/or books that I would recommend to get into DFIR and of course, continue to learn. So I have created a sub-page Resources with my recommendations. I will continue to update this page over time.

Richards Heuer, Jr. discusses in the book how fundamental limitations in human mental processes can prompt people to jump to conclusions and employ other simplifying strategies that lead to predictably faulty judgments known as cognitive biases. These analytic mindsets cannot be avoided, but they can be overcome through the application of more structured and rigorous analytic techniques including the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses.</td>

So why, when NSA engineer Charles Gandy filed for a visa to visit Moscow, did the Russian Foreign Ministry assert with confidence that he was a spy?Outsmarting honey traps and encroaching deep enough into enemy territory to perform complicated technical investigations, Gandy accomplished his mission in Russia, but discovered more than State and CIA wanted him to know.</td>

He had no way to foresee the advent of cyberwar. Whatever form any future war takes it is now apparent that cyber warfare will be part of it.<br>
    This four week short course introduces you to the rise of state sponsored cyber attack, a concept that only a few years ago seemed within the realm of science fiction.  You will be introduced to the major classes of cyber weapons: trojans, worms, and distributed denial of service, as well as sophisticated hacking. You will also learn the history of nation state involvement in cyber attack as well as the looming threat of cyber attack from terrorist organisations.</td>

I went from doing about a year of technical support back in 2010, to having a non-technical Access Management role for several years, then going straight into Incident Response. It was a HUGE jump. All of a sudden, I needed to know how to do digital forensics investigations, analyze malware, know what assembly code means, and a plethora of other things I didn’t know I needed to know. I definitely couldn’t afford to pay thousands of dollars for training.</td>

As such, one will gain insight in both the thought process, as well as the technical analysis.</td>
