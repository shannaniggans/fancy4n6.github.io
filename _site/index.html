        <p>It can seem daunting when starting out in DFIR and looking at all the tools and how much money might need to be expended to get a lab set up to even practice. But donâ€™t despair, there are plenty of open source and free tools available that you can use.</p>

        <p>I was lucky enough to get to BSides Canberra in 2021, but I did not have time on the day(s) to compete on the IR challenge. But the team at the ACSC have provided the challenge in its entirety and I have been working my way through the challenges and will write up each of the different sections on how I solved the challenge and what tools I used.</p>
