        In cyber security, it's easy to lose sight of why we are doing what we do. The world is increasingly full of amazing technologies, aiming to change everything from the way we travel to improving our health and taking us to space. How does security fit into this world and as cyber security folks, how can we change our role to enable and embrace this fast-paced new world?

Come while we talk about Lego, Robots, Space, Money, Sex and everything in between - it's a brave new security world and they need us.

    <td><h4><b>Back to Basics aka 'Why can't we get this shit right?!'</b></h4>Time and time again - especially recently! - we're seeing breaches occurring because (with 20/20 hindsight, of course!) something incredibly simple was missed. So if it was simple, if it was basic, if it was common sense - why was it missed?
    This talk will highlight some of the basic security steps that keep
    being missed, told from the perspective of someone who's been down in
    the trenches and is now helping other organisations rise to the task
    of getting all the boring, bland, simple, basic things right -
    *before* looking at all the new and shiny security tools that are out
    there.
    Covering a wide range of topics including identity, server management,
    hybrid cloud and security systems, this talk will take us all Back to
    Basics.
    The basics are your foundations - if you don't get them right, nothing
    will be right.

In the talk, I noted that each of the "ways" could use more detail and this talk is a deeper dive into the one I called "Oiliness and Stickiness".
I believe that by organisations embracing the concepts of oiliness and stickiness, they can leverage corporate culture to increase the effectiveness of the information security department beyond what the department can achieve on its own. 
I will present some practical examples that I have seen and how these have helped.

  <td><h4><b>DMARC for beginners (or, deflecting bounty begging)</b></h4>Email still runs on SMTP, which must be close to one of the oldest application protocols still in common use. Security was not a high priority design factor. Which can make it easy to spoof. Fortunately this can be mitigated with a few tweaks of your email provider settings (some even set it already for you; others just have wizards that suggest you fix it!)
However, effectively configuring these features, known as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, can often be overlooked in the presence of higher priorities, and coupled with wonderful free online reporting tools anyone can click a few buttons then send you a copy/paste message claiming they are an "ethical hacker", and could you spare them a bounty please? I will walk through the experience of first receiving one of these emails, discuss the relevant security settings, and then outline one approach for dealing with the subsequent annoyance that arises, making sense of the resulting flood of XML reports from your email providers.</td>

  <td><h4><b>Control Supply Chain Threats In Your Website</b></h4>Modern organisations depend on online transactions. In an ongoing pursuit to improve the digital experience, websites become extremely complex. They typically include content from dozens of third parties used for analytics, advertising, chatbots, payment gates and more. You end up trusting a lot of external parties. With this comes opportunities for attackers to abuse that trust by compromising your digital supply chain and inject malicious code into your website. This allows bad actors to perform attacks such as harvesting credit card information and other sensitive information. This was seen with the Magecart attack campaign which resulted in British Airways receiving hefty fines for that data breach.
 
While every customer will have a different risk depending on their use of third party content, defining the risk and associated controls should be included in every risk assessment.</td>

  <td><h4><b>Dancing, not Wrestling: Moving from Compliance to Concordance for Secure Software Developmen</b></h4>Secure software development has become an increasingly important
focus for research in recent years, not least because of advances
in technology such as AI, machine learning (AI/ML), robotics, and
autonomous systems (RAS). AI/ML and RAS facilitate automated
decision-making and have the capability to have a significant impact
on society. As such this technology needs to be trustworthy,
and secure software development is a key attribute for trustworthiness.
Software developers frequently have responsibility and
accountability for delivering secure code but limited authority over
how this is achieved. Authority tends to lie with cyber security professionals
who mandate security processes, tools and training often
with limited success. In an effort to find ways to improve secure
software development we take inspiration from healthcare research
that looks at the relationship between compliance, adherence and
concordance. We use this research as a lens through which to analyse
qualitative data from 35 interviews with professional software
developers. We argue that compliance and adherence causes friction
with the social practice of software development. We conclude
that if software developers and cyber security professionals could
move to a point of concordance it could lead to the negotiation of
more realistic cyber security solutions, as well as removing friction
from the practice of software developers and ultimately lead to the
development of more secure and trustworthy systems.</td>

  <td><h4><b>Scanning millions of domains and compromising the email supply chain of Australia's most respected institutions</b></h4>Abstract:
Curious to find out what happens when you perform OSINT at-scale? In this talk we'll discuss how the migration of email infrastructure from private to public cloud environments has significantly elevated the risks associated to IP takeover attacks.
We'll then discuss how a seemingly innocuous scan of 1.8 Million Australian domains resulted in the email supply chain of 264 Australian organisations being compromised.

Detailed Presentation Outline:
1. Introduction
Discuss what phishing is, how it has evolved and how an overlooked technique can be exploited to tip the table in favor of attackers. We'll talk about how email sender authentication is performed, how public cloud environments are ephemeral in nature and how trusted but unused IP addresses can be taken by threat actors with malicious intent.
2. Scanning millions of domains
Discuss the methods used to collate a target list that includes millions of domains. Then deep dive into what's involved in extracting the full IP supply chain of an SPF record and the infrastructure necessary to scan millions of targets.
3. Trawling available AWS IPs
Deep dive into IP takeover attacks on AWS' platform. Discuss what's involved in cycling through tens of thousands of IP addresses and how a persistent threat actor could continuously cycle through every available IP across all AWS regions ‚Äì which encompasses tens of millions of IPs. 
4. Sifting through the results
Discuss the process for cross referencing scanned AWS IPs against a repository of known SPF IPs and how a limited scan I performed (i.e. focusing on Australian domains, only scanning AWS IPs and only scanning 0.1% of the AWS EC2 IP Address space) resulted in compromised email supply chains for some of Australia's most respected institutions (i.e. Australian Parliament House, University of Sydney, and 262 more organisations). 
5. What's the impact?
Discuss how each of the affected organisations and their downstream customers are significantly more susceptible to business email compromise and phishing-related attacks. Anyone with a credit card can sign-up for an AWS account, cycle through EC2 instances until they get a desirable IP, request AWS to remove any SMTP restrictions and begin sending SPF authenticated emails as though they are any of these organisations.
6. Wrapping up
The outcome of this talk is to showcase how discovery and exploitation of this vulnerability can be automated and can yield high impact results ‚Äì emphasizing that I've only scanned organisations in Australia, only covered 0.1% of potential AWS IP addresses and haven't looked at any other major cloud computing provider (e.g. Azure &amp; Google Cloud), meaning there are likely thousands more vulnerable to this attack.

  <td><h4><b>How Do You Solve a (Cyber) Problem Like Small Business?</b></h4>(Title Lyric Reference: The Sound of Music ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaria‚Äù)

As a newly minted small business owner, having quit an IT career, I found it unbelievably hard to apply the security principles from my work, to my own business.  In this talk, I want to share some of the cyber-security challenges and opportunities that small business owners, like myself, face. My talk will draw from both my own experiences as a small business owner as well as the research done during my PhD.  I will explore some of the reasons cyber-security is harder for small business, before concluding with opportunities for technical and research communities to pitch in.
 
The talk will first cover the important, and often invisible, role that small business plays in Australian society and economy.  There is a human context to what a small business means to its owners.
 
Cyber-security challenges are not limited to technical reasons; some challenges derive from the fundamental characteristics of small businesses.
 
So, is it all bad news? No, there are opportunities for the community to help, 2 of which I will briefly explore:
‚Ä¢        Open source community ‚Äì Harness the talent within the open source community to address fundamental resource limitations that exist for small businesses.
‚Ä¢        Better tooling ‚Äì A pilot survey is currently underway that aims to better understand the use of IT by small businesses, (with details on how to participate) which can facilitate better solutions.
(Note: Some of these information draws from my published academic articles and talk I gave at AISA Cybercon in November 2021. Further details available upon request.)
